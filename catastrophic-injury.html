Catastrophic injuries require long-term medical treatment and rehabilitation—and not every injury lawyer can build a case at this level.</p>

                <p>This is where boutique representation matters. Just recently, Peerali Law received a call from a client and explained a common situation:</p>

                    <p>In the case mentioned above, the client's original attorney got a <strong>$74,000 offer</strong> from the liable party's insurer.

This was possible through qualifying the injuries as "catastrophic" and detail the full extent of damages—including future medical bills, loss of earning capacity and emotional suffering.</p>

                    <p>Peerali Law secured a <strong>$968,000 confidential settlement</strong> for a Lodi resident injured in a medical transport collision, resulting in severe arm fractures and lasting loss of sensation. The defense argued that compensation should be capped at just $250,000 because the injury occurred during medical transport, but through extensive case development and evidence work, we proved that the cap didn't apply. After detailing the client's emotional suffering, we recovered the maximum policy limits from both the employer's insurance and the driver's personal policy.</p>
