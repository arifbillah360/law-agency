                        <p>After a catastrophic injury, you're facing one of the hardest times in your life. Medical bills are piling up, you can't work, and insurance companies are already trying to minimize what you deserve. <strong>You need someone in your corner who truly cares.</strong></p>

                        <p>That's exactly what you get at Peerali Law. We're a boutique law firm in Los Angeles founded by <strong>Kristopher Peerali</strong> and <strong>Serena Peerali</strong> – two trial-ready attorneys who have recovered over <strong>$50 million since 2021</strong> for clients just like you.</p>

                        <p><strong>Here's what makes us different:</strong> You won't be handed off to a paralegal or case manager. You'll work directly, one-on-one with an experienced attorney who knows your name, understands your pain, and fights relentlessly for your future. We combine the expertise of a major firm with the personal attention you can only get from a boutique practice.</p>

                <p class="section-note"><strong>If you checked even one box above, you likely have a catastrophic injury case</strong> – and you deserve maximum compensation. Insurance companies will try to minimize your claim, but we won't let that happen. Here's proof:</p>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Real Results: How We Increased a Client's Settlement by 305%</h3>
                    <p>A Los Angeles car accident victim came to us three weeks before their court date. Another attorney had negotiated a <strong>$74,000</strong> settlement – but our client knew they deserved more. They were right to trust their instincts.</p>

                    <div class="case-result">
                        <div class="result-before">

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>The result?</strong> Through aggressive negotiation and expert trial preparation by Kristopher Peerali, we secured a <strong>$300,000 confidential settlement</strong> – more than 4X the original offer. And we did it before the court date, saving our client time and stress.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: #f7fafc; border-left: 4px solid #c5a572; font-size: 1.05rem;"><i class="fas fa-quote-left" style="color: #c5a572; margin-right: 0.5rem;"></i><strong>This is what happens when you have trial-ready attorneys who know your case is worth more.</strong> Don't settle for less than you deserve. Let us fight for you.</p>

                    <p>We achieved this by qualifying the injuries as "catastrophic" under California law and using our experience to build a much stronger case. This is why, if your injuries are serious, Peerali Law can get you the justice you deserve.</p>

                            <p>A catastrophic injury is one that results in permanent disability or long-term impairment. This includes brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, paralysis, amputation, severe burns, and injuries requiring extensive medical treatment or ongoing care. If your injury has permanently affected your ability to work or live independently, it may qualify as catastrophic.</p>

                            <p>Do not give a recorded statement or sign any documents without consulting an attorney first. Insurance adjusters may try to minimize your claim or get you to say something that could hurt your case. Politely decline to discuss the accident and contact Peerali Law immediately. We'll handle all communications with insurance companies on your behalf.</p>
