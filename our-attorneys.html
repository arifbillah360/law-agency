                            <h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i> About Kristopher</h3>

                            <p>Kristopher Peerali is the Co-Founding Partner of Peerali Law, a boutique personal injury firm in Los Angeles specializing in catastrophic injury litigation. With a background representing Fortune 500 companies in high-stakes litigation, Kris brings elite-level legal expertise to individual clients who need it most.</p>

                            <p>Before co-founding Peerali Law in 2021, Kristopher built a distinguished career in corporate defense, where he honed his skills in complex litigation and trial strategy. However, he felt called to work where he could make a deeper personal impact—representing individuals whose lives have been forever changed by catastrophic injuries.</p>

                            <p>Kristopher designed Peerali Law around one core principle: <strong>everyone deserves access to elite legal representation, regardless of their ability to pay upfront</strong>. This philosophy led to the firm's strict no-win, no-fee policy, ensuring that financial constraints never stand between a client and justice.</p>

                            <h4><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Trial-Ready Approach</h4>
                            <p>Kristopher's corporate litigation background gives him a unique advantage when facing well-funded insurance companies and their defense teams. He knows their strategies, understands their tactics, and prepares every case as if it will go to trial—even when pursuing settlement negotiations.</p>

                            <p>This trial-ready mindset has resulted in significantly higher settlements for clients. In one notable case, Kris took over a claim just three weeks before trial where the client had been offered $74,000. Through expert discovery and aggressive negotiation, he secured a $300,000 settlement—more than four times the original offer.</p>

                            <h4><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Personal Philosophy</h4>
                            <p>"Personal injury cases aren't just about minimizing corporate losses; these are people who need justice to rebuild their lives. Every client deserves attorneys who will fight as hard for them as we would for a Fortune 500 company."</p>
